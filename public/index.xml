      <description>I have been playing carrom since my childhood, and competed in local city tournaments. I have been crazy about this game since it requires a lot of quick thinking, concentration and analytical thinking, and hones skills like planning ahead, sharpens the mind and helps you make better predictions.&#xA;I have represented Denmark in EuroCup 2019, 2023 and 3 times in the Poland Championship. I am aiming to resume playing, keep representing Denmark in national tournaments &amp;amp; get Denmark recognized in Carrom EuroCup.</description>

      <description>Invented more than a century ago, carrom is a traditional Indian game. In India, carrom is practiced at home, in companies or in clubs. It is even found in the curriculum of some schools.&#xA;But today, Carrom is played internationally. The appearance of carrom in Europe dates back to the 1960&amp;rsquo;s following the growing interest in Asian cultures and travel. The Swiss were the first to import the game and play it in Europe.</description>
