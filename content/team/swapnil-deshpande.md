I have been playing carrom since my childhood, and competed in local city tournaments. I have been crazy about this game since it requires a lot of quick thinking, concentration and analytical thinking, and hones skills like planning ahead, sharpens the mind and helps you make better predictions.

I have represented Denmark in EuroCup 2019, 2023 and 3 times in the Poland Championship. I am aiming to resume playing, keep representing Denmark in national tournaments & get Denmark recognized in Carrom EuroCup.

I also play Carrom at Høj Tastrup DISA Sports club.
