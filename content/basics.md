Invented more than a century ago, carrom is a traditional Indian game. In India, carrom is practiced at home, in companies or in clubs. It is even found in the curriculum of some schools.

But today, Carrom is played internationally. The appearance of carrom in Europe dates back to the 1960's following the growing interest in Asian cultures and travel. The Swiss were the first to import the game and play it in Europe. Since then, the game has continued to spread throughout the world. There are now more than 30 nations attached to the Carrom Federation and conducting National tournaments as well as the prestigious EuroCup every year.
