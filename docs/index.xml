      <description>Invented more than a century ago, carrom is a traditional Indian game. In India, carrom is practiced at home, in companies or in clubs. It is even found in the curriculum of some schools.&#xA;But today, Carrom is played internationally. The appearance of carrom in Europe dates back to the 1960&amp;rsquo;s following the growing interest in Asian cultures and travel. The Swiss were the first to import the game and play it in Europe.</description>
